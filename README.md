# Angry-Birds-RPG
This is an Angry Birds themed role-playing game coded using Java with the goal being to retrieve an egg stolen by the pigs. It includes several mini-games such as tic-tac-toe, rock-paper-scissors, unscrambling, answering math questions, and more! I also included a points system, a loop system allowing the player to replay and a function for the text to print slowly.
